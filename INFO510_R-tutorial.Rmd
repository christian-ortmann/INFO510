# Week 1-2 Introduction to R: Exercise
# If seeing error messages, please review them and try to understand. It is a good practice for you debug.
# If seeing warning messages, please review. Warning messages are typically not fatal. Might be obsolete/deprecated. 

############### Universal things every R user should know ########

#to find which version of R you are using
```{r}
R.version
```

#R has many tools wrapped in packages, and we often use those tools in our work
#To use a tool, you need to install it
#The package used is DMwR2 
# In Windows 11, this shall run ok. 
# In Ubuntu 20.04, you might see error. one error requires run "sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev"
#
```{r}
install.packages("DMwR2")
```


#To see what is in a package, use help()
# If you do not see documentation, there might be errors
```{r}
help(package="DMwR2")
```

#The above step takes some time and you need internet connection
#Now the packages are installed in your computer
#To use a function in the package, either of the two ways works:
# (1) when you need to use the function frequently, you would want to load it to the memory for your current session by using library() function (one RStuido window is one session, if you have multiple RStudio windows open, they are different sessions )
# (2) when you only need to use the function one or twice, you can call the function/dataset through the notation package::functionname 

```{r}
library(DMwR2)
```


#Now you can use any function or dataset provided in DMwR2 by referencing its name directly.
```{r}
data(algae) #load algae dataset
algae  
manyNAs(algae) #find rows with too many NAs

head(algae)
tail(algae)

summary(algae)

```



#library() without arguments. It will provide you the list of packages installed in different libraries on your computer:
```{r}
library()
```



#show packages loaded in the current session
```{r}
(.packages())
```

#Think library() a library of all installed packages. library(packagename) checks a package out.
#.packages() as all checked out packages in the current session.


#If you loaded a package, say dbplyr,  by mistake, you can detach it from your session

```{r}
install.packages("dbplyr") #assuming you have dbplyr installed before 
#...
# now you try to check out dplyr, but typed dbplyr by accident
library(dbplyr) 
(.packages())
#you realized the mistake, and you don't want this package to be live in this session due to potential conflicts
#you can detach the package
detach("package:dbplyr", unload=TRUE) 
(.packages())
    
library(dplyr)#load wanted library
```



#Another way to see what packages have been installed in your computer
```{r}
installed.packages()
```



#to find your installed packages that have a newer version on CRAN
```{r}
old.packages()

```

#update all your installed packages to the newest version -- this may take a long time
```{r}c
update.packages()

```

#update all your installed packages WITHOUT having to confirm for each package (Note: as this could take a long time, you don't have to practice this command. Do not worry too much if you see warning or failure messages)

```{r}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)

```


#to find out the namespace/package a function belongs in your installed packages, just type the function name
#Function Mean is in base R
```{r}
mean 

```

#to find help on a function in an installed package, say "mean()". If you use R Studio, R documentation on the method mean() is display on lower right pane of the window 
```{r}
help(mean)
```


#if two packages provide a function with the same name and you need to use both functions, use package::functionname to differentiate the functions.


#when you want to see if a package you need to use has already been made, search for it using some keywords#
```{r}
RSiteSearch('neural networks')
```


```{r}
#useful controls in R Studio#
#Ctrl+1  Move focus to the Source Editor.
#Ctrl+2  Move focus to the Console.
#Ctrl+l  Clear the Console.
#Esc     Interrupt R.
```

# Project and Session Management

# Use Project to manage your R scripts and data.
# In RStudio, File > New Project to create a new folder on your computer for your project.
# Multiple scripts can be created and saved in the project folder, along with data used
# File > Open Project to resume your work in the workspace.
# Your project folder is your current working directory, where you can save your .R and .RData files.
# But a .R file can exist outside a project /project folder

# Close Project in RStudio closes the current project, but still keep the session (RStudio interface is still up)
# Quit Session closes the current RStudio window. 

# Typing long and complex commands in a console can be limiting.
# You can type all the commands in a text file and save it, then use
# [1] source('path_to_mycode.R') to execute the series of commands.
# or [2] open mycode.R in RStudio script tab and execute your commands from there using 'Run' or 'Source' button.
# Run: run the code line by line
# Source: run the entire script

# You often need to save large data objects or function for later use
```{r}
save(my.function, mydataset, file="path_to_mysession.RData")
#load("path_to_mysession.RData")
```

# To save all objects
# All objects are saved in ".RData" file in the current working directory for you to load in the future. 
```{r}
save.image()
```

#run getwd() and setwd() in RStudio Console to show the current working directory and to set working directory respectively.
```{r}
getwd()

setwd("/home/kunal/Documents") # setwd using what you get from getwd()

getwd()

```


################## R Objects and Variables###############
#variables are references to some storage locations in computer memory that holds some content (objects) that range from a simple number to an complex model# 
#to associate an object (in this number 0.2) to a variable#
```{r}
vat <- 0.2
```

#now see what vat holds#
```{r}
vat
```

#use () to enclose a statement to have the returned values print directly 
```{r}
(vat <- 0.2)
```

#more examples
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- vat * x
y

z <-(y/2)^2
y

z
```

#all variables stay alive until you delete it or when your exit R without saving them
#to list variables currently alive: ls() or objects()
```{r}
ls()

```
```{r}
objects()
```


#to remove a variable to free memory space#
```{r}
rm(vat)
```



#################### R Functions###################################

#functions are a special type of R object designed to carry out some operation 
#functions expects some input arguments and outputs results of it operation
#R has many functions already, libraries you loaded contains functions you can use, you can also create new functions
#examples of R functions

```{r}
max(4, 5, 6, 12, -4)

mean(4, 5, 6, 12, -4)

set.seed(1) #the seed determines the starting point used in generating a sequence of pseudo random numbers #set.seed() has global scope, meaning it affects all random number generators used/called in your program.
#there is a function to remove the seed:rm(.Random.seed, envir=.GlobalEnv)

max(sample(1:100, 30))

mean(sample(1:100, 30))
```

#why the same function with same argument gave different results above? Use help(sample) to find out what function sample does

#what do you expect?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
rnorm(1) #give me one number from a normal distribution
rnorm(1)

set.seed(2)
rnorm(1)
rnorm(1)

set.seed(1)
rnorm(1) #give me one number from a normal distribution
rnorm(1)

```
#we use set.seed() to make sure multiple runs of a program involving random samples give the same result, for debugging purposes.


#to create a new function, se (standard error of means), first test if 'se' existsin our current environment#
```{r}
exists("se")
```


#no object named 'se' exist, now create the function that computes the standard error of a sample
```{r}

}
```
#now object se has been created.

```{r}

################## factors ##########################

#Conceptually, factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values.
#a factor can be seen as a categorical (i.e., nominal) variable
#factor levels are the set of unique values the nominal variable could have.
#factors are different from characters. 

#to create a factor, use factor(). Factors are represented internally as numeric vectors. This factor has two levels, f and m.  
```{r}
g <-c('f', 'm', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'f')
g <- factor(g)
```
#more compact way to creating a factor with known levels, f and m
```{r}
other.g <-factor(c('m', 'm', 'm', 'm'), levels= c('f', 'm'))
other.g
```
#compare the above with the following
```{r}
other.g <-factor(c('m', 'm', 'm', 'm'))
other.g
```

#factors are extremely useful for norminal values
#Use factor to illstrate the concept of marginal frequencies or marginal distributions and table() function
```{r}
g <- factor(c('f', 'm', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'f'))
table(g)

```

#add an age factor to the table (table can have more than two factors)
```{r}
a <- factor(c('adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','juvenile', 'juvenile'))
table(a, g)

```

#R assumes the values at the same index in the two factors are associated with the same entity. In our dataset, we have 3 female adult, 2 female juvenile, and 3 male juvenile


#what if the a factor is not the same length as g factor? 
```{r}
a <- factor(c('adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','juvenile'))
table(a, g)
```

#bring the good a back and create a new table with factor g
```{r}
a <- factor(c('adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','adult', 'juvenile','juvenile', 'juvenile'))
t <- table(a, g)
t
```

#find marginal frequencies for a factor
```{r}
margin.table(t, 1)#1 refers to the first factor, a (age)
margin.table(t, 2)# now find the marginal freq of the second factor g
```

#we can also find relative frequencies (proportions) with respect to each margin and the overall
```{r}
t
prop.table(t, 1) #use the margin generated for the 1st factor a 
```

#adults are all female, and among the juveniles, 40% if female and 60% is male.


```{r}
prop.table(t, 2)


prop.table(t) #overall
```

#### Vectors #############
#the most basic data object is a vector. one single number is a vector with a single element#
#all elements in one vector must be of one base data type#

#to create a vector#
```{r}
v <- c(2, 5, 3, 4)

```


#data type of elements in v
```{r}

```{r}
v <- c(2, 5, 3, 4, 'me')
mode(v)
v
```
#see the difference? all values in the v have now become characters strings)

#All vectors can contain a special value NA, often used to represent a missing value
```{r}
v <- c(2, 5, 3, 4, NA)
mode(v)

```

#a boolean vector
```{r}
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA, TRUE)
mode(b)
b
```

#Elements in vectors are indexed starting with 1
```{r}
b[3]
```


#To update a value at a specific index
```{r}
b[3] <- TRUE
b
```


#vector is elastic, you can add values to any index position
```{r}
b[10] <- FALSE
b
```
#empty elements are filled with NA, as shown above

#to create an empty vector#
```{r}
e <-vector()
mode(e)
e <- c()
mode(e)

```





#use a vector elements to construct another vector
```{r}
b2 <-c(b[1], b[3], b[5])
b2
```
#vectorization is to perform an operation on each element of a vector#
#it is very powerful and used widely
#to find the sqare root of all elements in v#
```{r}
sqrt(v)
```

#vector arithmetic#
```{r}
v1 <- c(3, 6, 9)

#Warning: arithmetic with vectors of different sizes is legal in R
#R uses recycling rule to make the shorter vector the same length as the longer vector#

```{r}

v1+v3#the recycling rule makes v3 [1, 4, 1]
```

#remember, a single value is a vector too?
```{r}

######## Matrices and Arrays#################
#Arrays and matrices are essentially long vectors ***organized*** by dimensions
#Arrays can be multiple dimensions
#Matrices are two dimensional
#Hold same type of values

#To create a matrix

```{r}
m <- c(45, 23, 66, 77, 33, 44, 56, 12, 78, 23)

is.matrix(m)
is.array(m)
#then 'organize' the vector as a matrix
dim(m) <-c(2, 5)#make the vector a 2 by 5 matrix, 2x5 must = lenght of the vector
m
is.vector(m)
is.matrix(m)
is.array(m)
```

#by default, the elements are put in matrix by columns. Use byrow=TRUE to do it the other way#
```{r}
(m <- matrix(c(45, 23, 66, 77, 33, 44, 56, 12, 78, 23), 2, 5, byrow = TRUE))

(m<-m [, 2, drop = FALSE])
is.matrix(m)
is.vector(m)
```

#cbind() and rbind(): join togather two or more vectors or matrices, by column, or by row, respectively
```{r}

##############################  list ##################################
##Lists are vectors too, but they are 'recursive' (as opposed to the 'atomic' vectors we learned before: vector, matrix, arrays), meaning they can hold other lists, meaning a list can hold data of different types,
##List consist of an ordered collection of objects known as their components
##list components do not need to be of the same type.
##list components are always numbered (with an index) and may also have a name attached to them.

##use list$component_name to access a component in a *list*
##$ accessor can not be used on atomic vectors.

#[, [[, and $: https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-accessors-explained/

```{r}
mylist <- list(stud.id=34453,
               stud.name="John",
               stud.marks= c(13, 3, 12, 15, 19)
               )

```

```{r}

```

#  Subset with [ 
#      Both indices and names can be used to extract the subset. ( In order to use names, object must have a name type attribute such as names, rownames, colnames, etc. )
#      You can use negative integers to indicate exclusion.
#      Unquoted variables are interpolated within the brackets.

# Extract one item with [[
#      The double square brackets are used to extract one element from potentially many. For vectors yield vectors with a single value; data frames give a column vector; for list, one element
#You can return only one item.
#The result is not (necessarily) the same type of object as the container.
#The dimension will be the dimension of the one item which is not necessarily 1.
#And, as before:
#Names or indices can both be used.
#Variables are interpolated.

#Interact with $
#   $ is a special case of [[ in which you access a single item by actual name (but not used for atomic vectors]]. 
#   You cannot use integer indices
#   The name will not be interpolated.
#   Returns only one item.
#   If the name contains special characters, the name must be enclosed in backticks: “

#'mode' is a mutually exclusive classification of objects according to their basic structure.  The 'atomic' modes are numeric, complex, charcter and logical.  Recursive objects have modes such as 'list' or 'function' or a few others.  An object has one and only one mode.

#'class' is a property assigned to an object that determines how generic functions operate with it.  It is not a mutually exclusive classification.  If an object has no specific class assigned to it, such as a simple numeric vector, it's class is usually the same as its mode, by convention.

#Changing the mode of an object is often called 'coercion'.  The mode of an object can change without necessarily changing the class.  e.g.

#typeof or specific type testers: is.vector, is.atomic, is.data.frame, etc.

#However:

#class changed from 'matrix' to 'factor', but mode stays 'numeric'  
#At this stage, even though x has mode numeric again, its new class, 'factor', prohibits it being used in arithmetic operations.

#https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf

#filter() vs. select()
#select() selects a subset of columns of the dataset
#filter() select a subset of rows
#These two are often used in a nested fashion (like SQL SELECT/WHERE)
#Other useful functions provided by dplyr:mutate, summarise, arrange, and joins

#select petal lengths and widths of species Setosa: 
```{r}
select(filter(ir, Species=="setosa"), Petal.Width, Petal.Length)

filter(select(ir, Petal.Width, Petal.Length, Species), Species=="setosa")
```

**Exercise**
how would you achieve the same result as the above but use tibble subsetting?

```{r}
ir
ir[ir$Species=='setosa', c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length")]
subset(ir, ir$Species=='setosa', c("Petal.Width", "Petal.Length"))

#Pipe, %>%, pass the output of a function to another function as its first argument
#Very handy and widely used.
```{r}
select(ir, Petal.Width, Petal.Length, Species) %>% filter(Species=="setosa")
```
                                                                                        
**Exercise**
Pass the result from the filter to the select function and achieve the same result as shown above.

```{r}
filter(ir, Species=="setosa") %>% select(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, Species)
```
